# SynthPwr
Synthetic framework for stress testing the methodology (i.e., parameter setups and statistical power) of epigenetic power calculators. This tool helps to determine the optimal environmental setups for statistical power calculation (i.e., stress-testing) and evaluates the gap between synthetic EWAS and results derived from existing power calculators with matching parameters.
