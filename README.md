# SynthPwr
SynthPwr is an epigenetic power calculation framework for EWAS which is designed ontop of the pwrEWAS package and extended to examine power calculations when the signal in simulations are introduced based on the condition of methylation state (i.e., CpG beta values). This tool helps to build on the methodology of pwrEWAS by customising the inputs, configuring the conditons for introducing signals in simulations and structuring the outputs for power calculation.
